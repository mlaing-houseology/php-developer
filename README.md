# PHP Developer - Technical Test

## Scenario

You have been asked to create an API endpoint which can be integrated into a decoupled frontend movie reviews application.

You will need to provide the following functionality:

* Search movies based on the following criteria:
    * Release Date
    * Genre
    * Rating

You should setup a local database for this using the following structure;

### movies

id | name    | date_released       | genre  | rating
-- | ------- | ------------------- | ------ | ------
1  | Movie A | 2018-02-27 00:00:00 | Action | 5     
2  | Movie B | 2018-05-27 00:00:00 | Action | 4     
3  | Movie C | 2018-12-05 00:00:00 | Action | 5     
4  | Movie D | 2018-06-15 00:00:00 | Action | 3     
5  | Movie E | 2018-02-09 00:00:00 | Action | 5     


### Code Testing

Your code should be testable with PHPUnit - using test cases you will write as part of this scenario.
